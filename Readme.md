Texties is the fun new way to send Unicode and ASCII art to your friends! Explore a library of over 100 ASCII & Unicode artwork that you can send to your friends over SMS, iMessage, Email, Facebook, and Twitter!

* Select favorites for easy access to your most used Texties
* Send to: SMS, iMessage, Email, Facebook, and Twitter
* Copy to the clipboard to use anywhere
* Create your own unique c尺ﾑ乙ﾘ & upside down text and share your creations

If you love expressing yourself to your friends using more than words with Emoji, you'll love using Texties!

Stay tuned! We'll be adding more Texties to the library over time!

## How to run the app:

1. You must have a valid license of RubyMotion.
2. Run `bundle`.
3. Run `rake`
