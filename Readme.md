#### A [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) application brought to you by [Mohawk Apps](http://www.mohawkapps.com/).

Texties is the fun new way to send Unicode and ASCII art to your friends! Explore a library of over 100 ASCII & Unicode artwork that you can send to your friends over SMS, iMessage, Email, Facebook, and Twitter!

* Select favorites for easy access to your most used Texties

If you love expressing yourself to your friends using more than words with Emoji, you'll love using Texties!

Stay tuned! We'll be adding more Texties to the library over time!

This app is open source. Browse the source code here: https://github.com/MohawkApps/Texties/

## How to run the app:

1. You must have a valid license of RubyMotion.
2. Run `bundle`
3. Run `rake`
4. The simulator should launch automatically.

*Some features - like iMessage sending requires that you run it on an actual device. Building RubyMotion apps to a device is out of  the scope of this readme.*
