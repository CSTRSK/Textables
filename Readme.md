Texties is a fun way to send Unicode art to your friends!

Here are some of it's revolutionary and extrordinary features:

* Library of over 100 fun ASCII & Unicode artwork
* Send to your friends over SMS, iMessage, Email, Facebook, and Twitter!
* Select favorites for easy access to your most used Texties!

If you love expressing yourself to your friends using more than words with Emoji, you'll love using Texties!


## How to run the app:

1. You must have a valid license of RubyMotion.
2. Run `bundle`.
3. The simulator should launch automatically.

*Some features - like iMessage sending requires that you run it on an actual device. Building RubyMotion apps to a device is out of  the scope of this readme.*
