Texties is a fun way to send Unicode art to your friends! Explore a library of over 100 fun ASCII & Unicode artwork that you can send to your friends over SMS, iMessage, Email, Facebook, and Twitter!

If you love expressing yourself to your friends using more than words with Emoji, you'll love using Texties!

## How to run the app:

1. You must have a valid license of RubyMotion.
2. Run `bundle`.
3. Run `rake`
4. The simulator should launch automatically.

*Some features - like iMessage sending requires that you run it on an actual device. Building RubyMotion apps to a device is out of  the scope of this readme.*
